**[Show architecture diagram briefly]**

"The system uses Amazon Bedrock AgentCore for orchestration, Claude for intelligent reasoning, and AWS Lambda functions for autonomous job searching, resume optimization, and market intelligence."

### Student Onboarding Demo (0:30 - 1:00)

**[Screen: Student onboarding interface]**

"Let me show you how it works. When a student first uses the system, they input their graduation date. Watch what happens when I enter a graduation date that's only 2 months away..."

**[Enter graduation date 2 months in future]**

"The AI immediately recognizes the urgency - 'Only 2 months until graduation. Time to focus intensively on job search!' It adapts the entire experience based on this timeline."

**[Fill out profile: Software Engineering, Entry Level, San Francisco, skills]**

"I'll complete the profile with job preferences, location, and skills. The AI is already analyzing this information to create a personalized strategy."

### Market Intelligence Dashboard (1:00 - 1:30)

**[Screen: Market intelligence dashboard]**

"Here's where the magic happens - real-time market intelligence powered by Amazon Bedrock. Look at these insights:"

**[Point to salary charts]**

**[Highlight key metrics]**
"The system shows this role has a 7.8/10 job security score with 15% growth projected. This data helps students make informed career decisions."

### Autonomous Job Search (1:30 - 2:00)

**[Screen: Job search interface]**

"Now watch the autonomous job search in action. The AI agent continuously scans job boards and uses Claude to intelligently match opportunities."

**[Show job listings with match scores]**

"Each job gets an AI-calculated match score. This 92% match at TechCorp is flagged as excellent because it aligns perfectly with the student's skills and salary expectations."

**[Click apply button]**

"When I click apply, the AI agent automatically tailors the resume using Amazon Bedrock's language models, optimizing it specifically for this job description."

### Resume Optimization Demo (2:00 - 2:30)

**[Screen: Resume optimization results]**

"Here's the AI-optimized resume. Claude analyzed the job requirements and restructured the content, added relevant keywords, and improved the ATS compatibility score from 5 to 8."

**[Show cover letter]**

"It also generated a personalized cover letter that references specific company details and demonstrates genuine interest in the role."

**[Show application insights]**

"The system provides strategic insights - highlighting strengths, identifying potential gaps, and recommending interview preparation topics."

### Closing & AWS Integration (2:30 - 3:00)

**[Screen: Architecture overview]**

"This entire system runs on AWS infrastructure. Amazon Bedrock AgentCore orchestrates the workflow, Claude provides the intelligence, Lambda functions handle the processing, and S3 stores all documents securely."

**[Show automation features]**

"The agent works autonomously - running daily job searches, sending notifications through SNS, and continuously learning from market data."

**[Final screen: Results summary]**

"The AI Career Agent transforms job searching from a manual, time-consuming process into an intelligent, automated system that adapts to each student's unique timeline and goals. It's not just a job search tool - it's a career intelligence platform powered by AWS AI services."

**[End with project links]**
